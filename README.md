Project Title:
üõçÔ∏è ProductsGallery - Product Gallery

Description:
ProductsGallery is an interactive web application designed for displaying products. It allows users to browse a wide range of products, view their details, and add them to a shopping cart. The goal of this project is to provide a seamless shopping experience and an appealing user interface, complete with full support for Dark Mode and robust search and sorting features to easily find products.

The application uses a mock API to fetch product data, making it an ideal showcase for frontend development skills and interaction with external data sources.
